# Semi-automated LaTeX Lab report templates

## Purpose
The purpose of this semi-automated template is to provide a flexible and
practical way to write LaTeX lab reports while minimizing repetitive actions
for every new report.

This templace in particular is my own template for the Faculty of Organization
and Informatics in Vara≈ædin, HR. Feel free to fork this repository and adapt it
to your own institution.

## Usage
1. Edit `Makefile` to your heart's content to "configure" the report
2. Write the report by editing `report.tex`
3. Type `make`
4. ???
5. Profit
